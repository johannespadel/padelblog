# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Padel Blog project created as a learning exercise for Claude Code in terminal. The goal is to create a simple blog about padel (a racquet sport).

## Current State

The repository is in early initialization phase with:
- Basic README documentation
- Git repository setup
- No technology stack chosen yet
- No build tools or dependencies configured

## Technology Stack

**Status**: Not yet determined. Future decisions needed:
- Web framework/static site generator
- Styling approach (CSS framework, preprocessor)
- Content management approach
- Deployment strategy

## Repository Structure

Currently minimal with only essential files. Future structure will depend on technology choices.

## Development Setup

No specific setup required yet. Once a technology stack is chosen, development commands should be documented here.

## Notes for Claude Code

- This is a learning project specifically designed for Claude Code practice
- Technology decisions should be made collaboratively with the user
- Focus on simplicity and educational value over complexity
- When adding new technologies, always explain the choices and setup process
