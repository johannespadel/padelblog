# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal blog project by Johannes Padel, created as a learning exercise for Claude Code in terminal. The goal is to create a simple personal blog.

## Current State

The repository is in early initialization phase with:
- Basic README documentation
- Git repository setup
- Technology stack defined but not yet implemented
- No build tools or dependencies configured yet

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js** - React framework for production with static site generation
- **React** - Component-based UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript for better development experience
- **Sanity** - Headless CMS for managing blog posts and content
- **GitHub Pages** - Static site hosting and deployment platform

**Future considerations**:
- Styling approach (CSS framework, preprocessor)
- Additional Next.js features and optimizations

## Repository Structure

Currently minimal with only essential files. Future structure will depend on technology choices.

## Development Setup

No specific setup required yet. Once a technology stack is chosen, development commands should be documented here.

## Notes for Claude Code

- This is a learning project specifically designed for Claude Code practice
- Technology stack is defined: Next.js + React + TypeScript + Sanity + GitHub Pages
- Focus on simplicity and educational value over complexity
- When implementing features, follow Next.js and React best practices
- Ensure TypeScript types are properly defined
- Consider static site generation for GitHub Pages compatibility
